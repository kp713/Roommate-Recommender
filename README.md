# Roommate-Recommender
# roommate_recommendation 



Hey there! This repository is for a roommate recommender built by a team of 4 from the PGDM batch of Madras School of Economics. This submission  was a part of my graded  group project for the course on Data Science. First a google form was created to collect data of users, using Google API to extract the data to python. The recommender uses HEOM and KNN to extract recommendations. A separate recommender for text and non-text data was made, the code also incorporates gender preferences. Check out the repo and please feel free to fork and reach out to us.  Thanking you, KP
